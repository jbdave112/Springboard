# Springboard

Various projects completed as part of the Springboard Data Science Career Track. Through these projects I have learned many skills including:

1. Data Wrangling: Obtaining data from different sources and preparing it for analysis
2. Data Storytelling: Letting the data tell you a story through descriptive statistics and visualizations
3. Inferetial Statistics: Using a random sample of data to describe and make inferences about a population
4. A/B Testing: Testing whether the difference between two versions is statistically signficant
5. Machine Learning: Using various modelling techniques, such as: Random Forests, SVMs, GBMs, to create predictions based on data
6. Deep Learning: Creating different types of neural networks such as LSTMs and using them to create predictions
7. Spark: Using PySpark to perform data science at scale
